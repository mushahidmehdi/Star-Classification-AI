# NASA-Star-Classification-AI-Model
This is a star classication project by NASA, I'm doing this project as a hobby and explore differnt Model using sklearn. 

Let talk about starts firt, when we look at the night sky,we notice that some stars shine more brightly than others. The brightness of a star is related to how much energy it puts out,
as well as how close it is to Earth.
Stars also vary in color â€“ because they vary in temperature. Hotter stars appear blue or white, while cooler stars look orange or red. Astronomers use these
characteristics to classify main sequence stars into categories by color and temperature: O (blue), B (blue-white), A (white), F (yellow-white), G (yellow),
K (orange), and M (red), from hottest and biggest to coolest and smallest. Stars at the ends of their lives are out of the main sequence. These include supergiants
,red giants, and white dwarfs.
